  <h1>Privacy Policy for WhatsApp Business Platform App</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how TS v-development Limited ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, stores, and protects information received through our WhatsApp Business Platform App ("the App"). The App facilitates customer communication by receiving and responding to messages via the WhatsApp Business API. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your data.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The App receives and processes messages sent by customers through the WhatsApp Business API. This may include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Customer Messages:</strong> Text, media, or other content sent by customers to our WhatsApp Business account.</li>
    <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Information such as message timestamps, sender phone numbers, and other communication-related data provided by the WhatsApp Business API.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect additional personal information beyond what is provided through the API for the purpose of customer service interactions.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Processing</h2>
  <p>To enhance our customer service, the App uses third-party AI services, such as OpenAI API, to process customer messages and generate automated responses. By interacting with our WhatsApp Business account, customers explicitly consent to the transfer and processing of their messages by third-party services for the purpose of generating automated replies.</p>

  <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>The information collected via the App is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Customer Service:</strong> To receive, process, and respond to customer inquiries and requests, including using third-party AI services.</li>
    <li><strong>Service Improvement:</strong> To analyze communication patterns and improve our customer service processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Internal Communication:</strong> Where necessary, customer-provided contact information (e.g., name, phone number, company name, email) may be shared with authorized internal departments (such as sales, technical support, or customer service teams) to ensure timely and appropriate handling of customer requests. All internal sharing is conducted securely and strictly limited to business purposes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage:</strong> All messages and related data are stored securely on our servers, located in AWS (United States) and within our own managed infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>Security Measures:</strong> We implement industry-standard security measures, including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits, to protect your data from unauthorized access, loss, or misuse.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Data is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy or as required by applicable law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
  <p>We do not share, sell, or disclose customer messages or personal information to any third parties, except as explicitly stated in this policy (for example, processing via third-party AI services) or as required by law or to comply with legal obligations (e.g., in response to a court order or legal process).</p>

  <h2>Your Rights</h2>
  <p>As a user interacting with our App via WhatsApp, you may have certain rights under applicable data protection laws, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The right to access or request information about the data we hold about you.</li>
    <li>The right to request the deletion of your data, subject to legal or contractual obligations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@tsvd.com.hk">admin@tsvd.com.hk</a>.</p>
